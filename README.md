# Algorithmic Analysis of Graph Isomorphism Problem

-----

This project presents an algorithmic analysis of a computational problem i.e. graph isomorphism. The problem is also called ”graph matching” problem and lies at the heart of myriad fields including computer vision and pattern recognition. Such an importance drives need to look for solutions that are not only appropriate but also efficient. The objective is to analyse time efficiency of solving graph isomorphism problem, which is known to be a NP class problem, using different algorithmic design techniques
