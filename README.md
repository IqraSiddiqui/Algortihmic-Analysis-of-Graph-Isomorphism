# Algorithmic Analysis of Graph Isomorphism Problem

-----

This R&D project was completed for one of the course: CS 412 Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Spring 2022 at Habib University
It presents an algorithmic analysis of a computational problem i.e. graph isomorphism. The problem is also called ”graph matching” problem and lies at the heart of myriad fields including computer vision and pattern recognition. Such an importance drives need to look for solutions that are not only appropriate but also efficient. The objective is to analyze time efficiency of solving graph isomorphism problem, which is known to be a NP class problem, using different algorithmic design techniques
